<!-- BEM entity - It includes block, element and modifier  
     features of BEM entity
		 1. behavior
		 2. appearance
		 3. tests
		 4. templates
		 5. documentation
		 6. description of dependencies
		 7. additional data (eg images)

		 rules for naming BEM entity - must be able to separate blocks from elements and modifiers.
		 1. standard BEM style - block-name__elem-name_mod-name_mod-val
		 2. two dashes style - block-name__elem-name--mod-name--mod-val
		 3. came case style -  blockName-elemName_modName_modVal
		 4. react style - BlockName-ElemName_modName_modVal
		 5. no namespace style - _available 
-->

<!-- As per BEM(block element modifier) 
	  1. block that is functionally and logically independent component that allow for reuse.
		2. block don't change margin and position and contains no CSS tag and ID selector 
		3. block encapsulate
		   3.1 behavior 
			 3.2 templates
			 3.3 styles
		4. blocks can be nested inside any other blocks.
		5. blocks can change position on page or between pages or projects without modify CSS and javascript.
		6. an interface on webpage can contains multiple instances of same block.
		7. When to use block?
			  block is used when section of code might be reused and it doesn't depend on other page
				components.
		8. technologies used to implement block (as per features of BEM entity)
		   8.1 behavior - javascript, CoffeeScript
			 8.2 appearance - CSS, Stylus, Sass
			 8.3 templates - BEMHTML, BH, Pug, Handlebars, XSL
			 8.4 documentation - Markdown, Wiki, XML
		 9. block implementation (using above technologies ) can be redefined by adding new features
		    on different level.  
-->

<!-- As per BEM(block element modifier) 
	  1. element that is composite (include many parts) and always associated with block.
		2. element can't be used outside of block.

			nesting of elements is allowed but element must always part of block and not of element.
			NOTE: when nesting of elements, block name tells namespace that gurantee elements dependent 
						on block .
			
						NOTE: element shouldn't be used separatedly from block.
			NOTE: element is optional component and any block can avoid it.

			When to use element?
			If block of code can't be used separately without parent (block)
			when element is divided into subelements then create service block instead of 
			associate element to each other.
-->

<!-- Modifier : As per BEM
	    1. modifier is an entity that tells appearance, state and behavior of block or element.
			   modifer name - appearance or state or appearance
				              - eg theme_islands, disabled, directions_top
			2. modifier name is separated from block by '_'
			3. use of modifier is optional.
			4. similar to HTML attributes.
			5. modifier can change in runtime or via other blocks.
			6. types of modifier
			   6.1 boolean - when presence or absence of modifier is important but not it's value.
				     how to write: block-name_modifier-name
						               block-name__element-name_modifier-name
				 6.2 key-value - used when modifier value is important
				     how to write: block-name_modifier-name_modifier-value
						               block-name__element-name_modifier-name_modifier-value
							NOTE: can't use identical modifier with different values simultaneously.
							      eg  <form class="search-form
                          search-form_theme_islands
                           search-form_theme_lite">
			7. modifier can't be used along on HTML element but must be used to change appearance,
			   behavior, state of BEM (block element modifier) entity

				 incorrect use
			   form class="search-form_theme_islands">
				 
				 correct use
				 	<form class="search-form search-form_theme_islands">
				     		
-->

<!-- file structure - as per BEM
	   1. block 
		    1.1 single directory must include only single block.
		    1.2 directory and block must have same name.
		    1.3 block implementation must be divided into separate files.
		    1.4 block directory must be root directory that contains subdirectories
		        for elements and modifiers.
		 2. elements 
		    2.1 names for element directories must begin with '__'
		    2.2 implementation of element must be divided into separate files.
		 3. modifier 
		    3.1 names for modifier directories must begin with '_'
		    3.2 implementation of modifier must be divided into separate files.

		 4. types of file structure implementation
		    4.1 flat 
				    4.1.1 directories aren't used for blocks
						4.1.2 optional elements and modifiers in separate files or main block file. 
				4.2 flex
				    4.2.1 separate directory for each block.
						4.2.2 elements and modifiers can be implemented in separate files or inside block files.
